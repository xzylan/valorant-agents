            <img src="./Loading_Screen_Ascent.webp" alt="">
            <p>In Valorant, Ascent is characterized by its central open area and two bomb sites, A and B. The map's design emphasizes mid-control, as controlling the middle of the map can provide access to both sites and allow for quick rotations. Ascent features numerous vantage points and elevated positions, encouraging vertical gameplay and the use of abilities to gain a tactical advantage. The open spaces and narrow chokepoints create a balanced mix of long-range engagements and close-quarters combat, making it a versatile and dynamic battleground.</p>

            <p>Haven stands out in Valorant with its unique design featuring three bomb sites: A, B, and C. This setup demands teams to master quick rotations and versatile defensive strategies to cover more ground effectively. The map's structure includes multiple entry points and varied terrain, encouraging diverse playstyles and strategic depth. Defenders must constantly adapt to the attackers' movements, while attackers can exploit the multiple sites to create confusion and divide the defense. Haven's distinctive layout challenges players to think on their feet and coordinate effectively with their team.</p>

            <p>Pearl is an underwater city map introduced later in Valorant's lineup. Its intricate pathways and submerged environments provide dynamic sightlines and opportunities for ambushes, making strategic planning and map awareness crucial. The map features two bomb sites, A and B, with a mix of open areas and tight corridors. Pearl's unique aesthetic and design elements, such as transparent walls and water-filled sections, add a layer of complexity to engagements. Players must navigate the map's distinctive terrain and use their abilities creatively to outmaneuver opponents and secure victory.</p>
